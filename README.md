#### About SABL: Sequentially Adaptive Bayesian Learning

## The aim of SABL-Projects
The aim of this site is simple:

> To collect real-use examples of SABL from all application domains
> for the benefit of new users

These examples supplement the [original guide](https://www.uts.edu.au/sites/default/files/article/downloads/SABL_handbook_2015a.pdf) written by Professor John Geweke in 2015.  From these examples, a new SABL user (with a moderate Matlab programming background) can take code snippets that will be useful in their own application for:
- [x] Setting up the Matlab global variables required by SABL
- [x] Importing .CSV data
